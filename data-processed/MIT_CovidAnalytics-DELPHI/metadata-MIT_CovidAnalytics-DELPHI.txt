methods: This model makes predictions for future cases based on an SEIR model taking
  into account underdetection and government intervention. Projections assume the
  last implemented intervention continues.
methods_long: 'This model makes predictions for future cases based on a heavily modified
  SEIR model. New states are added to the SEIR model to account for cases that went
  undetected, and an explicit death state is included. The infection rate is corrected
  with a nonlinear curve that represents the governmental and societal response (which
  is assumed) to continue until the end of the pandemic). Key parameters for the disease
  are fixed using a metanalysis  conducted by the CovidAnalytics group of over 150
  parameters while epidemiological parameters are fitted to hisotical death counts
  and detected cases. '
