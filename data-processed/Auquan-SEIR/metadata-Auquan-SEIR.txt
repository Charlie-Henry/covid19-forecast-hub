data_inputs: JHU reported daily deaths, reported daily confirmed cases, population
license: cc-by-4.0
methods: Modified SEIR model with compartments for reported and unreported infections.
  Non-linear mixed effects curve-fitting.
methods_long: We start with a standard SEIR model and break down the Infectious compartment(I)
  into reported infections (Ir) and unreported infections (Iu). People from the Exposed
  compartment(E) with symptoms go into the reported infections (Ir) compartment. People
  with mild or no symptoms go into the unreported infections compartment. Both reported
  infections (Ir) and unreported infections (Iu) contribute to disease spread, but
  at different rates - a low spread for people quarantined in compartment Ir, and
  a high spread for, often, asymptomatic people in compartment Iu. This handles the
  quarantine measures taken by countries to limit the infections. Some people in reported
  infections (Iu) recover (compartment C) and some die (compartment D) All people
  in unreported infections (Iu) recover (compartment Cu), there are no mortalities
  in this compartment. If their symptoms were serious enough they would be reported
  (and therefore in compartment Ir). We fit our model to reported confirmed cases
  and reported deaths in a region to estimate beta1 and beta2 for that region. For
  other parameters, we use estimates from other studies as starting point and learn
  using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between projected daily
  deaths and reported daily deaths.
