data_inputs: reported deaths, government restrictions and recommendations, mobility
  data, surveys on isolation behavior

methods: 'Model assumes pandemics hit in 3 distinct phases. Each phase can be represented
  by a single variable and therefore the variables can be isolated. '
methods_long: "Simplified model: Deaths(x) = Deaths(x-1)*R  * (1-E) * (1-H) where\n\
  \            R is the rate of growth in a given society with no prior infections\
  \ and no societal intervention.\n            E is the effectiveness of societal\
  \ interventions such as social distancing, face masks, etc.\n            H is the\
  \ % of the population with immunity to the virus\n    In modeling E known societal\
  \ restrictions are used for near-term projections. Projections greater than 1 month\
  \ out assume that \n            effectiveness will be adjusted relative to the daily\
  \ deaths at that location on April 30. i.e.  The more that day's deaths is below\
  \ the April 30,\n            mark the greater the effectiveness will be reduced\
  \ and the more that day's deaths exceed deaths on April 30, the more the effectiveness\
  \ is increased.\n    In modeling H, death totals and not infection totals are used.\
  \ Current assumptions being a 0.50% death rate and 20% of the population had \n\
  \            some prior resistance."
