methods: The Agent-based local stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission
methods_long: "This model incorporates the reported geographic incidence data, which\
  \ include individual\u2019s age, infection status, and the severity of the disease.\
  \  The model accounts for the latent period of the individual\u2019s infection before\
  \ detection and proper reporting as well as for different disease severity levels.\
  \  The framework also allows to incorporate the exact geographic addresses of individuals\
  \ (if available) or the random geographic distribution of individuals."
