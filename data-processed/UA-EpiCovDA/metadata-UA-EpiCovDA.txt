methods_long: 'EpiCovDA is an extension of the EpiGro model. To combine Covid-19 data
  with the model during the pandemic, a variational data assimilation  method is used
  (sometimes called  4D-Var) to fit model parameters. For the data assimilation piece
  of EpiCovDA, a  prior  distribution of the parameters was estimated by fitting the
  model to states whose epidemic curves were further along early during the pandemic.  See
