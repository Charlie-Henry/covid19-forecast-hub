methods_long: 'The SEIR Model makes forecast of cumulative deaths, incident deaths,
  incident hospitalizations by fitting predicted cases, deaths, and hospitalizations
  to the observations. Quantiles of the forecast are derived from forecast error (comparing
  latest observation and corresponding forecast) rescaled based on days forward of
  forecast. '
